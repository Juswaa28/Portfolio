      <p class="abstract">This capstone project focused on the formation and development of a new queuing 
        transaction system, composed to have a faster, easier, and more efficient way for 
        the Bago City College Registrar’s office. “Bago City College Registrar Office 
        Queuing and Appointment Management System” is the title of this capstone 
        project. The registrar’s office transaction and processes will be automated by the 
        technology. They frequently conduct daily transaction and activities using manual 
        methods. The issues and mistakes that arise during the process will be eliminated 
        by this method. Paper data collected was used, along with in-personal interviews with the Registrar Office personnel at Bago 
        City College.</p>

        <p class="shooter">The game is called "ALIEN SHOOTER" and is based on the original
            game “Space Impact." Nokia developed this series of mobile game, which can
            be played on the 3310 device. In Space Target, the player can move freely in
            both vertical and horizontal directions, allowing for a variety of your
            desired directions. If you want to advance to the next level in this game, you
            must eliminate all of the invaders and achieve the required score. The primary
            character in the “Space Target” is a spacecraft, which is strong enough to
            protect their planet from terrifying monsters by firing at them with its weapon.</p>
